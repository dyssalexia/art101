      <h2>CHALLENGES</h2>
      <p>For lab 14, I found myself challenged by adding a debugger into my code, as well as by working more individually. It was tough to work with my partners without having a chance to meet in person and collaborte, as it was harder to articulate any problems I ran into succinctly over discord. I was able to challenge myself further this week my learning how to create an automatic popup message on a site by myself, as it was part of my contribution to my group's Team Project. </p><br>

    <div id="problems">
      <h2>PROBLEMS</h2>
      <p>As for actual problems with my code, I only ran into those I was easily able to fix by correcting syntax and ordering. I was pleasantly surprised with my progress in problem solving and correctly coding. The largest problem I encountered through the week was being unable to connect with the class in person. </p><br>

      <h2>RESULTS</h2>
      <p>My results can be seen upon loading this page, with the implementation of a pop-up message. I also added debugging breakpoints into this lab to test my progress, which can be seen in the screenshot below. </p>
