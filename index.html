  <p> alex (they/she) is a student at UC Santa Cruz finishing up a undergraduate degree in Studio Art with a minor in History of Art and Visual Culture. Their own art practice usually consists of print making and photography, though they intend to pursue a career path in musuem curation or media. She also knows that as good as that sounds, she's really just 22, she just quit her job, and she's typing this out from her bed at 2pm on a Monday. She's also hungover. Their favorite song is a tie between My Blood by Pom Poko or Walden Pond by Atta Boy, and they have been saving up for tattoos dedicated to both for months now. She is particularily proud of her ability to find designer brands at thrift stores and she thinks something she should bring up next week in therapy is her need to 'gentle parent' her parents.</p>
